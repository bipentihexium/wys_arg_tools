This is second version of the algorithm bruteforcer :)

## Why I made this?

The first version had just random expressions, which is useful, but not when you are completely stuck... So there are random instructions this time.

## How to use?

As with the first bruteforcer - use `cmake`/`build_linux_gcc.sh`/`build_win_mingw.bat` and configure it with changing `cfg.hpp`. Now it has even CTest tests :). It builds the executable you can use afterwards :).
Type `exit` (and enter) to stop the search.
